# Vanilla WoW Armory with Discord interface

## Features
- Invitable Discord bot.
- Anonymus users will have access to:
  - Search for various ingame objects with command: $search searchText*
  - Register to the application with command: $register
- Registered users will access to:
  - Create character with command: $character-create
  - List created characters with command: $character-list [@userMention]

## Installation
Currently the bot is not deployed, so you have to run it on your computer, using MAVEN to install, build, and run it.
You have to set first the ownerId, and discord bot token in the application.properties, which I added a sample only.
