# Vanilla WoW Armory with Discord interface

## Features
- Invitable Discord bot.
- Search for various ingame objects.

More planned feature here: [Vanilla WoW Armory Trello board](https://trello.com/b/sDiDwVVN/vanilla-wow-armory)

## Installation
Currently the bot is not deployed, so you have to run it on your computer, using MAVEN to install, build, and run it.
You have to set first the ownerId, and discord bot token in the application.properties, which I added a sample only.
